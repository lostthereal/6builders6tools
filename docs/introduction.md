## About 6b6t
---
6b6t is the largest cracked anarchy server, running on Folia server software that along with other optimizations, allows 1000 users to be online at the same time in one world. Just like other anarchy servers, it has no rules, no punishments and no chat filters. However, ***unlike*** other anarchy servers it has /tpa and /home, and while in one way this might remove the aspect of traveling, the reason for these commands are explained [here](https://www.6b6t.org/en/blog/minecraft-anarchy-server-tpa-home). 6b6t is managed by owner *qbasty* which started the server on January 16th, 2022, and has merged maps with 7b7t, created with the hopes of being the best lag-free anarchy server with no queues.
